10:10- opening up question Prompts
### Question 1 - turning strings into URLs 
  -DO NOT USE replace() or any regular expression.
  -according to mdn web docs regular expressions are used with these methods 
    -exec()
    -test()
    -match()
    -matchAll()
    -search()
    -replace()
    -replaceAll()
    -split()
  
  -plan is to create string array from the input, then use join to insert "20%" in the spaces

  The Plan:
  output = input.join('20%');
